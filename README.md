# Mini-KataGo

My own implementation of Go AI, similar to [KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo).

## Timeline

### Week 1

Implemented basic Go board engine and a simple minimax file for tac-tac-toe that will be later used for Go as a depth-limited MiniMax (and probably see it fails badly)

New features include:

-   Place move at specific position with specific color
-   Captures detection
-   Ko detection
-   Score estimation at the end of the game
-   Illegal move detection
-   Display a real Go board with MatPlotLib

### Week 2

Implemented a basic depth-limited MiniMax algorithm for Go with alpha-beta pruning. It checks all possible moves in a given board state and choose the local optimal one by choosing the move that captures the most opponent's stones. Also did some minor updates to the board class.

New features include:

-   Depth-limited Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
-   Auto game-over when there are 2 consecutive passes
-   Undo feature for game board

### Week 3 (WIP)

Implemented a basic pure Monte Carlo Go Simulation and Tree Search. It works by randomly choose legal position to play and calculate the win rate.

New features include:

-   A basic pure Monte Carlo Go Simulation
-   A basic Monte Carlo Tree Search
-   A new Node class data structure

## Development

To start developing this project locally. Run the following command:

Install UV:

```bash
uv --version  # check if UV is already installed

# If it is not installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # MacOS & Linux
# or
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Clone the repository and setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YianXie/Mini-KataGo  # Clone this repository
cd Mini-KataGo
uv init  # initialize the virtual environment
uv sync --dev  # install the dependencies
```

Now you are ready to start developing. To see a quick demo, you may go the `main.py` and try a few different .sgf files or play your own.

Happy developing!

## Tests

This project contains some tests that you can run while developing to make sure everything works as expected.

To run tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
```

```bash
pip install -e .  # IMPORTANT: run at root level, otherwise Pytest would not work
```

```bash
pytest  # Run at root level. This would run all tests.
```

To add more tests, simply add a new Python file in the `tests/` directory. Note that it must start with `test_xxx` or `xxx_test`

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The `ci.yml` workflow runs on every push and pull request, performing code quality checks including Ruff linting, Mypy type checking, isort import sorting validation, and pip-audit security scanning. The `tests.yml` workflow runs pytest tests on pushes to the main branch and all pull requests targeting main, ensuring that all tests pass before code is merged.
